Austin Benchmark Suites for Computational Electromagnetics

In software engineering, a "proto-benchmark" is defined as a set of tests used to compare the performance of alternative tools or techniques that is missing one of the components of a proper benchmark; most commonly, a performance measure (S. E. Sim et al., "Using benchmarking to advance research: a challenge to software engineering," in Proc. Int. Conf. Software Eng. May 2003). Both proto-benchmarks and benchmarks can be used to demonstrate features of a new computational system (algorithm, code, supporting software, hardware), while only benchmarks can also systematically combat the ubiquity of error, ameliorate the hazards of specialization, fortify scientific integrity, and inspire research.
