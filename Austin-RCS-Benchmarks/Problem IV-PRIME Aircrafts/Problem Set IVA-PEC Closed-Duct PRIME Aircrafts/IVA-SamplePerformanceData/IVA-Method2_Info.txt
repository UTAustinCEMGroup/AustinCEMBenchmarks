Name: AIM

Formulation: Frequency-domain combined-field integral equation with CFIE parameter alpha=0.5

Algorithm: Iterative method-of-moments solution using triangular elements with RWG basis/testing functions
	   Fills impedance matrix entries with numerical integration with singularity extraction for self and near-singular terms
	   Diagonally-preconditioned TFQMR with 10^-4 relative residual
	   Accelerated with a parallel adaptive integral method; algorithm described further in [1]-[3]
