Name: H-ACA

Formulation: Frequency-domain combined-field integral equation with CFIE parameter alpha=0.5

Algorithm: Iterative method-of-moments solution using triangular elements with RWG basis/testing functions
	   Fills impedance matrix entries with numerical integration with singularity extraction for self and near-singular terms
	   Diagonally-preconditioned TFQMR with 10^-4 relative residual
	   Accelerated with a parallel hierarchical matrix approach, where matrix blocks are compressed with adaptive cross approximation; algorithm described further in [1]

Software: Implemented by CEM group at UT Austin, modern Fortran, Intel Fortran compiler v19.1.1
          Used LAPACK v3.12.0 libraries

Hardware: Lonestar6 at the Texas Advanced Computing Center [2]
